## Basics of using git

Git is a distributed version control system (VCS) that is very popular. 

The core steps to using git involve 

1. Initiate a git repository
    In RStudio we just click a little radio button on project creation 
    At the command line we type:
    `git init`
    
2. Do your normal work
    Add files
    Modify files etc.
    
3. Add your important files to the "stage" 
    In RStudio we click "stage" radio button
    `git add yourfilename`
    
4. Commit your stage files to the repository
    In RStudio you just hit the "Commit" button and add a msg
    `git commit -m "your wee msg"`
    
    
5. Git Push to sync chnages to GitHub
  The Up arrow in RStudio
  `git push`
  
6. Git Pull to sync FROM GitHub
  The Down arrow in RStudio
  `git pull`
  
You can check your project "history" and status
    `git status`
    `git log` (push Q to exit)
